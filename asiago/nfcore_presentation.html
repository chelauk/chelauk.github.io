# Pipelines
* Pipelines are an essential part of processing biological data.
* raw data is run through a series of pieces of software.
* each piece of software has settings options and requirements.

# There is a lot of workflow software available

# nextflow
a commonly used workflow organiser which has several advantages.

The central principle of nextflow is that an *input* which can variable representing say a file goes into a named `process`
which then produces an *output* which may be used by a further `process` down the line


```nextflow
process INDEX {
    input:
      path transcriptome 
    output:
      path 'index' 
    script:
      """
      salmon index --threads $task.cpus -t $transcriptome -i index
      """
  }
```

---
# nextflow
within the nextflow system these processes can easily be organised
### workflows

```nextflow
include { INDEX; FASTQC; QUANT; MULTIQC } from './some/module/script.nf' 

read_pairs_ch = channel.fromFilePairs( params.reads)

workflow {
  INDEX( params.transcriptome )
  FASTQC( read_pairs_ch )
  QUANT( INDEX.out, read_pairs_ch )
  MULTIQC( QUANT.out.mix(FASTQC.out).collect(), multiqc_file )
}
```

---

### and subworkflows
```nextflow
workflow RNASEQ {
    take:
      transcriptome
      read_pairs_ch
   
    main: 
      INDEX(transcriptome)
      FASTQC(read_pairs_ch)
      QUANT(INDEX.out, read_pairs_ch)
  
    emit: 
       QUANT.out.mix(FASTQC.out).collect()
  }
```

### HPC
nextflow runs on hpc using all the common workload managers

### 53 pipelines and counting

.image-33[![Centre-aligned image](./images/sarek_workflow.png)]
```R
nextflow run sarek -profile singularity
```


---

want to build your own pipeline?

```nextflow
nf-core tools create
```
add modules into the pipeline?
```nextflow
nf-core tools module insert
```

* The principle of the nf-core architecture is that it is standardised as much as possible

* nf-core also encourages sharing because if you have a pipeline it is likely to be useful for someone
else
---

# software

installing software is often a nightmare because of dependencies and permissions

* nf-core solves that by using self contained systems like docker and singularity

These are automatically downloaded and utilised when you run the pipeline.
The docker/singularity images match those environments available on conda.
